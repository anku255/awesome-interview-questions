**Question**: How do we measure `forty-five minutes` using `two identical wires`, each of which takes an hour to burn. We have matchsticks with us. The wires burn `non-uniformly`. So, for example, the two halves of a wire might burn in 10 minute and 50 minutes respectively?<br/>
**Answer**: Light up three of the four ends of the two wires. Once one wire is completely burnt which will be 30 minutes, light up the fourth end. At 45 minutes, both wires are burnt completely.<br/>
